The start of the output for each test will have either "[x]" or "[ ]",
depending on whether your program operated correctly ("[x]"), or
incorrectly ("[ ]"). It will be followed by the name of the file being
tested, whether that file is valid or invalid, and a brief description of
either what is being tested or the error contained within. After all the tests
have been ran, your score will be displayed as both the number you got correct
out of 51, and what percentage you got correct.

All of the files named either "header_invalidX.csv" or "data_invalidX.csv" were
written by Ian Malerich, who posted a suite of useful test cases on Blackboard.
