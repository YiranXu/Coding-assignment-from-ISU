1. Hw2 wrote functions in C for a weather dataset to calculate statistic summaries like mean, variance and max/min and passed all 36 tests


2. HW4 simulated audio signals using design pattern and UML diagram in C++. It is one of the projects 
I'm most proud of because alhough I encountered many problems from understanding audio-related concepts to debugging in C++, 
I solved all of my problems by discussing with Professor and TA and researching on my own. 

All of the projects achieved an almost perfect scores and past all test.
